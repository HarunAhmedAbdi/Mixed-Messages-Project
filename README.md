# Mixed-Messages-Project
### Welcome to my mixed messages project. Within this project, I will be demonstrating my abilty to create a program that will output a random message based on user input

## Introduction
The project's aim is to build a program based on the knowledge I acquired so far learning JS. The project will take the shape of a program that will output a random message to the end user. The theme for these messages will be astrological. At the end I aim for the program to be stable and return a random message that was put together from three pieces of data.
### Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## Technologies
The technologies that I will be using during this project are as follows:
JS
node.js
git & github version control system (VCS)
Visual Studio Code (VS Studio)
Command Line

## Scope of functionalities
This program will consist of generating a message and returning it to the end user. This message will consist of three random pieces of data that will be randomly chosen. I hope to achieve this by storing the messages in a array structure within an object literal. The random messages will be chosen with math.random method (and math.floor method for a round number). I will then output to the console the messages using string concatenation.

## Launch
I do not plan to launch this program. However I want to get it to a launch state in order to test my capabilities.

## Project status
This project is still in development stages. There is nothing to note about the progress so far.

## Sources
The source of this project originated from CodeCademy's Mixed messages portfolio project. The link can be found here.
